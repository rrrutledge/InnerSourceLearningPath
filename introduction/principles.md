# Inner Source Principles

Every company, team, project, and individual is different.
Because of that fact, the exact way that the concept of inner source works will vary from one situation to another.
At its core, however, are two principles that form the bedrock of any successful instance of inner source.
These principles have inspiration in successful open source projects and must be respected and present in order for inner source to achieve the benefits described earlier.

The principles are:
* **Openness**
* **Transparency**

Let's take a look at each of these principles in more detail.

These things make inner source run smoother

How can we apply inner source without espousing open source principles
Proposal: Explain how the values work together.  None operates in isolation.

## Openness

This key principle of open source applies to inner source as well.
Projects need to be open for discovery and modification.
That's more than just the ability to view the raw source code.
Think about the ethos of an open source.
When you see an "open" sign there are certain expectations that you have.
People want you in there.
Things should be obvious where to go when you get in.
There's likely a place where you can ask if you need help while you're inside.
In a similar way, open source projects need to incorporate openness to both users and also contributors.
It's easy and document what the project is, how to use it, and how to get involved as a contributor.
It needs to be obvious that you want people there.
They feel welcome

When a store is open

Openness: projects need to be set up in a way that makes contributions possible in the first place)
projects are set up so that they can be widely accessed for reuse and ongoing improvements

## Transparency

Transparency is important
It means that people can see how the project is managed.
Roadmaps are made available.
Procedure for modification is made clear.
Aspects of governance are documented and followed where others can observe them.
This sptep is important so that others can know that they want to participate and where they can participate.

Transparency: work products, progress, decision making must be transparent in order to be able to work asynchronously)
projects are oriented so that all progress, decision making and current state is visible and accessible

## Maintenance

Inner source projects need to be maintained.
There needs to be someone watching out for bug fixes, paying attention to the overall architecture, and making sure that the dirty work actually gets done.

This could happen via meritocracy or assignment
When meritocracy if rewarded, you see people rising to fill these tasks to get more merit.
You can also make sure that they happen by making sure that some regular, top-down funded team is assigned as the maintainer of an inner source projects.

Discussion of meritocracy vs. assignment
What do you mean by meritocracy?
Rank in the community is not determined by organizational status
Could be fear that the corporate team that’s sponsoring an inner source project doesn’t have a say?
Proposed Goal: Share content that is acceptable for the widest range of viewers.  Openness and transparency feel more universal than meritocracy.
Meritocracy helps to organize and motivate ownership and maintenance (e.g. the un-fun stuff like taking out the trash).  An alternative model to motivate ownership is assignment where a person or team is assigned from the top-down to own a software project.
Present meritocracy and assignment as two alternative ways of achieving ownership and maintenance.  Choice of which one to use depends on your culture.
In general we think that meritocracy is a higher path to take, but not all cultures may be ready for it so it’s important to acknowledge that they can get started on inner source via the assignment model.
Ownership and maintenance is very important to have one way or another.  We’ve seen inner source projects fail that are very open and transparent, but do not have clear ownership/maintenance

## Conclusion

Inner source is (technically) possible without anything.
Your inner source effort will scale more if you follow them.
Following these principles is not zero and one, black and white.  It’s a scale and continuum.
